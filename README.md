# TODOS List Projects

This repository is to create simple (not that simple) todo lists. I want to explore new patterns, languanges and concepts. You will find here first contact with some languages or frameworks. My main stacks are .NET and React, so everything different from this its new for me, at least when I write this text :) (05/29/2022)

# The Project
Create a TodoList with CRUD. 

## Back end
Create the endpoints, data validation until the database insert. I will not insert into database into these projects. The ideia its keep simple, and right now I dont want to integrate with databases.

## Front end
Create a visual CRUD with user interaction. My idea is save the data into memory. 


## In the end of the day
I dont want to create a very complex or a perfect project here. I want to develop on my free time and sometimes I dont plan to finish all the project, just a small piece to understading something new or so.
