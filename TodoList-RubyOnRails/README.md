# Todo list using Ruby on Rails

This was my frist project using Ruby on Rails. I created a simple todo list with pagination (without gem packages). As a first flight I think the project is fine but now I have to learn to create more complex stuff. My next project will be an e-commerce using ruby and react. Lets see whats happen :)
